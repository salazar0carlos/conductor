This PR contains anti-patterns that will cause build failures in production.

**Common issues:**
- Module-level Supabase client initialization
- Constructor-level client initialization
- Build-time environment variable access

**To fix:**
1. Run \`npm run validate\` locally to see specific errors
2. Review the [Bulletproofing Guide](../BULLETPROOFING.md) for correct patterns
3. Push your fixes
